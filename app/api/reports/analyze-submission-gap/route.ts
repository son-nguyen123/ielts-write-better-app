**Essay Details:**
- Title: "${submissionTitle}"
- Weakest Criterion: ${getCriterionFullName(weakestSkill)}
- Current Score: ${currentScore.toFixed(1)}
- Target Score: ${targetScore.toFixed(1)}
- Gap to Close: +${gap.toFixed(1)} points
${keySuggestion ? `- Identified Issue: "${keySuggestion}"` : ""}

**Your Task:**
Provide specific, actionable guidance to help the student improve from ${currentScore.toFixed(1)} to ${targetScore.toFixed(1)} in ${getCriterionFullName(weakestSkill)}.

**Structure your response as follows:**

## Key Issues to Address

List 2-3 specific problems that are preventing the student from reaching the target score in this criterion.

## Step-by-Step Improvement Plan

Provide a concrete action plan with 3-4 specific steps the student should take to improve.

## What Success Looks Like

Describe what a ${targetScore.toFixed(1)} response looks like for ${getCriterionFullName(weakestSkill)}, so the student knows what to aim for.

## Practice Exercise

Suggest one specific exercise or technique the student can use immediately to practice this skill.

**Important:**
- Be specific and actionable - avoid generic advice
- Focus on the ${gap.toFixed(1)}-point gap that needs to be closed
- Reference IELTS band descriptors for ${getCriterionFullName(weakestSkill)}
- Be encouraging but realistic about what needs improvement
- Keep your response concise but comprehensive (300-400 words)`
